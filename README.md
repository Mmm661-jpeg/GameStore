## Step 1: Setup

Clone the repo
Remove the connection to the old git
Make my own repo on github and connect

## Step 2: Deploy azure app service
1. **Find app services on azure and click on the create button**
2. Create a new resource group
3. Choose a name
4. **Runtime Stack** (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python). Choose **Linux** or **Windows** as the OS.
5. A region where the app will be hosted
6. A pricing plan (F1 cheapest 0$)
7. Zone redundancy disabled makes the avalibility higher but costs money
8. No database
9. **Continuous deployment enabled**
10. Connect to Github account
11. Enable public access
12. **Enable Application Insights**
13. **Review and Create**

A .YML file will be generated that triggers on pushes to main branch or a manually. This will update your app then redoply it shortly after. Contains in it the necessery commands to build, publish and upload the app.
The app gets built and packaged and finally the compiled package is then uploaded to Azure under `wwwroot`, where files are served statically (depending on framework/runtime used)

## Step 3: Application insights 

Make sure to activate Application Insight when configuring app service in the begining otherwise you can go down to the setting and also turn it on that way:

    Settings -> Monitoring -> Application Insights: Turn it on and connect to a resource.
  
With **Application Insights** enabled, you can monitor your application's behavior and troubleshoot issues directly from the Azure portal.
There is a  **Search** tab, where you can browse through all telemetry data, such as requests, traces, exceptions, and dependencies. This gives you a chronological view of whatâ€™s happening in your app.

## Step 4: Configure Security

1. **Access Control (IAM)** : You can choose to gran certain users diffrent levels of access.

       App Service -> Access Control (IAM) -> Add -> Add Role Assignment -> Reader (A user than has read access) -> Find a user to asign this too ->  Review and Assign

2. **SSL / HTTPS**  
Azure assigns a default domain (`yourapp.azurewebsites.net`).  
This domain is automatically secured with a **free SSL certificate**, which enforces **HTTPS** for secure, encrypted communication.


## Auto scaling

Only avaliable to higher tiers. Requires Premium v2 or Premium v3

App service -> Settings -> Scale out -> Automatic

This is a feature used to automaticly scale your app based on demand.

## Storage account

1. Find and add a new storage account 
2. Connect to your resource group and name the storage account
3. Pick a region  
4. Choose Azure Blob storage as primary service 
5. Standard performance
6. LRS: Locally-redundant storage
7. In advanced settings choose cool for the acces tier as well be accesing data infrequently
8. read and review

*The steps not mentioned just choose the defualt settigns given as the suffice*

### Uploading and using files

To upload and use files for your storage you will need to configure a **container**.

1. Data storage -> Containers
2. New container (+) and then give it a name
3. Now that you have a container you can upload files and use your files.

Before that its best to either configure a SAS (Shared Access Signature) or allow anonymous access to container.

To allow anonymous access go to storage account -> Settings -> configuration -> Allow Blob anonymous access (Enable) -> Back to container -> Change access level -> Blob or container.

**SAS:**

Settings -> shared access tokens -> configure and generate

now you can use this token at the end of your requests and this allows you to access your blobs (read,write,delete etc..)

### Key vaults

1. Find Key Vaults
2. Create
3. Unique name
4. Region (same as resource)
5. Standard
6. Azure role-based access control
7. Public endpoint 
8. Review and create

Then you go too Access control (IAM) and give your account the Key Vault Administrator role

Secrets -> Generate/Import -> Add a name and a value.
